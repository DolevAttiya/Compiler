#Notes#

Rotem does all:

1. Add an EOF token and make the lexical analyzer run in loop until it detects the EOF.

2. Fix the comment's regex (Waiting for Gila's response)

3. Fix the format of the output messages

4. Need to upload:

     1. Information.txt 
	
     2. Zip to the releases when we finish and test it on everybody's computers
	

* Note for all: Pay attention to the assignment's submission instructions
